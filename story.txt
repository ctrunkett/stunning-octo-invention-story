Once upon a time there was this dumbass who decided to study for exams instead
of writing her program,then she failed her exam and didnt finish her program.
Yikes. Now she's sitting in the CS basement drinking vending machine coffee 
on a friday.

However, it is still not the end for her. The coffee is kicing in and she is 
feeling full of energy. A last 10 hour marathon can still be done to finish
her code.
