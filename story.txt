Once upon a time there was this dumbass who decided to study for exams instead
of writing her program,then she failed her exam and didnt finish her program.
Yikes. Now she's sitting in the CS basement drinking vending machine coffee 
on a friday.

However, it is still not the end for her. The coffee is kicing in and she is 
feeling full of energy. A last 10 hour marathon can still be done to finish
her code.

She drank coffee and didn't sleep for 10 days. She aced every single test
that was given to her and everyone wondered how she did it. She then was 
nominated for a nobel prize for her work. She attended the ceremony and prepared
to give her speech.

However, someone is envy at her, and decided to kill her on the speech. Before the week
that the girl gonna give speach, she made a super AI. The AI gets connect to the Internet.
Due to the calculation of the AI, she was informed that someone will kill her, so she sent
AI to attack that guy's computer. The guy cannot finish his due on time, so he spends a whole
week working on the project, then he misses the speech and fail to kill the girl. After the
speech, the AI learns more and more stuff through the Internet and figures out that humam
beings are the worst and dangerous animals in the world. The AI runs away. The girl realizes
that a few days after. She ask help from the United Nations to build a team of the most clever
scientist in the world to fight the AI. To be continued.
